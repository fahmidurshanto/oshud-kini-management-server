# HttpOnly Cookie Authentication Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the CORS and HttpOnly cookie authentication issues.

## Problem Identified

1. **CORS Configuration**: The backend was not properly configured to handle credentials (cookies)
2. **Cookie Handling**: The backend was not setting HttpOnly cookies properly
3. **Token Extraction**: The middleware was extracting tokens from Authorization headers instead of cookies
4. **Missing Dependencies**: The cookie-parser middleware was not installed

## Solution Implemented

1. **CORS Configuration Fix**:
   - Added `credentials: true` to CORS configuration
   - Ensured proper origin configuration

2. **Cookie-Parser Middleware**:
   - Added cookie-parser middleware to parse cookies
   - Updated server.js to use cookie-parser

3. **HttpOnly Cookie Implementation**:
   - Updated authController.js to set HttpOnly cookies on login/register
   - Added logout functionality to clear cookies
   - Updated middleware to extract tokens from cookies

4. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Updated all service files to use withCredentials: true
   - Removed localStorage token handling

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **server.js**:
   - Added cookie-parser middleware
   - Updated CORS configuration with credentials: true

2. **authController.js**:
   - Modified login/register to set HttpOnly cookies
   - Added logout function to clear cookies
   - Removed token from response body

3. **authRoutes.js**:
   - Added logout route

4. **authMiddleware.js**:
   - Updated to extract token from cookies instead of Authorization header

### Frontend Changes

1. **All Service Files**:
   - Added withCredentials: true to axios configuration
   - Removed manual token handling

2. **AuthProvider.jsx**:
   - Removed localStorage token handling
   - Simplified authentication flow

## How It Works Now

1. **User Login**:
   - User submits credentials
   - Backend validates and sets HttpOnly cookie
   - Frontend receives success response without token

2. **API Requests**:
   - Axios automatically includes cookies with credentials
   - Backend validates cookie and authenticates user
   - No manual token handling required

3. **User Logout**:
   - Frontend calls logout endpoint
   - Backend clears HttpOnly cookie
   - Frontend updates user state

## Security Benefits

1. **XSS Protection**: HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript
2. **CSRF Protection**: SameSite attribute prevents CSRF attacks
3. **Secure Transport**: Secure flag ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS in production
4. **Automatic Handling**: Browser automatically handles cookie transmission

## Testing the Fix

1. Restart the backend server
2. Try to login through the frontend
3. Check browser dev tools Network tab for:
   - Set-Cookie header in login response
   - Cookie inclusion in subsequent requests
4. Verify no CORS errors in console
5. Test logout functionality
