# API Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes made to resolve the backend API integration issues in the Oshud Kini Management System.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Service Endpoint Issues
**Problem**: The frontend was trying to access separate endpoints for dashboard stats and activity that didn't exist in the backend.

**Fixes Made**:
- Updated `dashboardService.js` to use the single `/api/dashboard` endpoint that returns both stats and activity data
- Modified functions to extract the required data from the combined response

### 2. Salary Service Endpoint Issues
**Problem**: The frontend was trying to access endpoints (`/current-month`, `/history`) that didn't exist in the backend.

**Fixes Made**:
- Updated `salaryRoutes.js` to include the missing endpoints:
  - `GET /history`
  - `GET /current-month`
  - `POST /process`
  - `POST /adjustment/:employeeId`
- Updated `salaryController.js` to implement the missing functions:
  - `getSalaryHistory`
  - `getCurrentMonthEmployees`
  - `processSalaries`
  - `addAdjustment`

### 3. Employee Service Endpoint Issues
**Problem**: The frontend was trying to access endpoints (`/stats`, `/:id/deactivate`) that didn't exist in the backend.

**Fixes Made**:
- Updated `employeeRoutes.js` to include the missing endpoints:
  - `GET /stats`
  - `PUT /:id/deactivate`
- Updated `employeeController.js` to implement the missing functions:
  - `getEmployeeStats`
  - `deactivateEmployee`

### 4. Authentication Issues
**Problem**: The frontend was sending `email` field but backend expected `username` field.

**Fixes Made**:
- Updated `AuthProvider.jsx` to send `username` field with email value for both login and registration

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files
1. `src/services/dashboardService.js` - Updated to use correct endpoint
2. `src/services/salaryService.js` - Kept existing implementation (now works with backend)
3. `src/services/employeeService.js` - Kept existing implementation (now works with backend)
4. `src/AuthProvider.jsx` - Updated field names for authentication

### Backend Files
1. `routes/salaryRoutes.js` - Added missing endpoints
2. `controllers/salaryController.js` - Implemented missing functions
3. `routes/employeeRoutes.js` - Added missing endpoints
4. `controllers/employeeController.js` - Implemented missing functions

## Testing

After implementing these fixes, the following API endpoints should now work correctly:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/me`

### Products
- `GET /api/products`
- `GET /api/products/:id`

## Next Steps

1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on the system
2. Start the backend server with `npm start` or `npm run dev`
3. Start the frontend application with `npm run dev`
4. Test all CRUD operations in the application
5. Verify authentication flows work correctly

## MongoDB Setup

If MongoDB is not installed or running, follow these steps:

1. Install MongoDB Community Server from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Start MongoDB service:
   - On Windows: `net start MongoDB` or run `mongod` in a terminal
   - On macOS/Linux: `sudo systemctl start mongod` or run `mongod` in a terminal

## Verification Commands

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. Check MongoDB connection:
   ```bash
   cd oshud-kini-management-server
   npm run check-mongodb-connection
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd oshud-kini-management-server
   npm start
   ```

3. Test API endpoints with curl or Postman:
   ```bash
   # Test root endpoint
   curl http://localhost:5000/
   
   # Test authentication (replace with valid credentials)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"test@example.com","password":"password"}'
   ```
